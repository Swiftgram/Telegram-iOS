# Something changed in Telegram versions 11.8.1 -> 11.10
# https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS/compare/release-11.8.1...TelegramMessenger:Telegram-iOS:release-11.10
#
# Since then, all binaries and libs are linked to the /usr/lib/swift/libswift_Concurrency.dylib instead of expected @rpath/libswift_Concurrency.dylib,
# this makes swift-stdlib-tool to ignore libswift_Concurrency.dylib and not copy it to the app bundle.
# This causes crash on every system that expects this backport (iOS 14 and below).
# This script will remap the path to @rpath/libswift_Concurrency.dylib in all binaries of the App, it's only needed for iphoneos target in this project.
# This is a temporary fix until minimum OS version will be bumped to iOS 15+ or Xcode version changed to 16.3 (with Swift 6.1 support)

# find "$1" -type f \( -perm +111 -o -name "*.dylib" \) | while read -r bin; do
#   if otool -L "$bin" | grep -q "/usr/lib/swift/libswift_Concurrency.dylib"; then
#     echo "Patching concurrency backport in: $bin"
#     install_name_tool -change /usr/lib/swift/libswift_Concurrency.dylib @rpath/libswift_Concurrency.dylib "$bin"
